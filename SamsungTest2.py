'''
	Write a function to rotate an array to the right by a specified factor.
	example: Input array [ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 ]
	Rotate to right by 4 Output array[ 4, 5,6,7,1,2,3]

'''
	Write a function to take one integer input buffer, 
	and another list of integer values. 
	Return how many times each of the integer values are in the buffer

'''
	Given a MxN integer matrix whose element is either 0 or 1 randomly. Now we define
	"Connected Regions" as one defined by 1s' -
	Assign a region number to each element

	REMARK:
	=======
	How to handle this problem:
	Suppose you are running this program on an embedded device with only 256MB 
	memory, and the matrix is super large like several GBâ€™s saved on a file in the disk. 
	How would you update the matrix in that file the same with question 1? 
	(Please explain here how to handle. (Not coding)
	
	1) 	The 5GB image has to reside somewhere we assume it is residing in a data storage of some sort
	2) 	The bst model to use is of Virtual Memory i.e. extending RAM into Disk Storage
	3) 	This Virtual Memory setup should be transparent to the application
	4) 	The application would deal with the virtual size and the Virtual Memoty System (VMS) will
		take care of swapping virtual pages (chunks of arrays) into memory for processing
